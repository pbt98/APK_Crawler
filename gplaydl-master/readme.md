## Detailed Instructions
So the brief instructions didn't get you going? Here is a detailed guide for you. Let's begin with installing the package using PIP3.

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade --force-reinstall gplaydl
```

If `gplaydl` is already installed on your system, it will be upgraded to the latest version as we are forcing PIP to install from the latest release.

or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rehmatworks/gplaydl.git && \
cd gplaydl && \
python3 setup.py install
```
**Attention:** Only Python 3.2.x and up is supported. Please use PIP3, not PIP (if PIP is aliased to Python 2.x PIP)

```bash
gplaydl configure
```

You will be asked to provide the login info. Provided the following details:
